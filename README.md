## Short history
Kabel New Media AG, based in Hamburg, was a well-known German Dorcom full-service agency led by Peter Kabel, 
which became famous in the New Economy through rapid growth and a spectacular stock market listing in 1999, 
but ultimately had to file for bankruptcy in 2001 due to the bursting of the dot-com bubble. The company 
designed websites and complex e-commerce system applications, including SAP integration, acquired many 
companies in Europe, was valued at over a billion euros at times, but lost massive value due to the global 
market crisis and ultimately went bankrupt, with insolvency proceedings being opened in the summer of 2001.
Peter Kabel remained active as a professor at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences and as an investor, 
while the company itself no longer exists.
